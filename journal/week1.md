# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- watched week 1 live stream and was able to follow along and get crudder running in docker via GitPod. I ran into the same issues Andrew did on stream but was able to overcome those problems quickly. Luckily, I have pheriperally aware of docker and how it works.

- watched **create notification feature video**
    - followed along with andrew
    - added notification to OpenAPI file
    - got the notification page working and made sure notification is highlighted when active.

- Watched **DynamoDB and Prostgres** video
    - added dynamodb and postgres configs to dockercompose file
    - followed Andrew and got both DBs running.
    - Ran dynamodb queries against local dynamodb
    - tested postgres client in gitpod
        - installed postgres extension
        - successfully connected to postgress db running in docker
